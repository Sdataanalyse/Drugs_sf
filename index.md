In the start of 2020 the whole world got impacted by the Corona pandemic, which lead to a dramatic change in everyday life for people all of the world (Wollf et al., 2022). 
Because the scaling number of positive COVID-19’s cases, there were quickly implemented strict lockdown in numerous cities around the world. In NYC, state of emergency was declared on March 12 , 2020, which meant that the New Yorkers should stay at home, observe social distancing, closing non-essential businesses, schools, restaurants, gyms, and playgrounds. 
The first lockdown period in NYC lasted from March 12 to June 7, 2020, whose purpose was to flatten out the curve of COVID-19 infections. After the first lockdown period, a series of structured reopenings phases was initiated, which lasted to the end of July 2021. The reopenings was followed by second and third “waves” of higher infections (Wollf et al., 2022).
It quickly became the “new normal”, not only in NYC but all of the world, which led to big social changes such as a change in criminal behavior (Wollf et al., 2022) (City of New York Criminal Justice Agency, 2020.)

*NB! Most of the crime plots is interactive, so please feel free to explore the NYC crime data by our own.*

#### Changing criminal behavior in NYC due to COVID-19
Upon a quick glance at the data, it is evident that New York City (NYC) experienced a significant overall decrease in the number of crime complaints and arrests for the ten most affected crime categories (Sex crimes, Drugs, Burglary, Larceny, Assault, Murder, Rape, Robbery, Prostitution, and Disorderly Conduct) during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

This trend aligns with the general pattern observed in cities worldwide, where crime initially dropped in the early weeks of the COVID-19 shutdown but began to rise afterward as residents grappled with the economic and health consequences of the pandemic (Akinnibi & Wahid, 2022).

In NYC, the number of crime complaints decreased by 11.3% (from 230,982 to 204,797), and arrests experienced an even more substantial decline of 32.2% (from 106,190 to 71,972) in 2020 compared to 2019 (see figure 1). Although the number of crime complaints started to increase in towards 2021, it remained below the pre-pandemic level.

##### Higher level of crime in NYC after COVID-19
Christopher Herrmann, assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, states that the overall picture for 2022 statistics in New York City is alarming, with a significant increase in crime. According to Herrmann, "crime is up in New York City, and it's up quite a bit" (Marcius & Shanahan 2023)

This increase is reflected in the number of crime complaints, which rose by 15.6% (from 230,982 to 267,012) compared to pre-COVID levels in 2019, reaching the highest level within the period.

In contrast, arrests experienced a decline in 2022, with a decrease of 11.4%. This decline was mainly driven by significant drops in cases related to disorderly conduct, drugs, and prostitution.
###### More complaints after COVID-19 in all five districts 
Looking at the distribution of complaints across the five boroughs in New York City, it is clear that all of boroughs follow a similar pattern: complaints dropped in 2020 and then began to rise again in 2021, ultimately resulting in the highest number of complaints in 2022 as compared to the previous three years. 

*Figure 2: Complaints per 100,000 residents across boroughs*
<iframe src="https://raw.githack.com/Sdataanalyse/Sdataanalyse.github.io/main/Pictures/Complaints_map_per_100.html" width="130%" height="650px"></iframe>
Furthermore, the distribution of complaints across the five boroughs shows a consistent trend, with Manhattan having the highest number of complaints per 100,000 residents, followed by the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, with Staten Island at the bottom.
Manhattan, as the borough with the highest population density, represents a vibrant tapestry of residents hailing from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses. This unique amalgamation of people can give rise to a greater likelihood of potential conflicts, which subsequently contributes to a higher volume of reported complaints.
Conversely, The Bronx, while not as ethnically diverse as Manhattan, faces its own distinct set of challenges. The borough is characterized by a comparatively higher poverty rate, with median incomes roughly half of what is seen in areas such as Staten Island or Queens. This economic disparity can be correlated with higher crime rates and, consequently, a greater number of reported complaints (Wollf et al., 2022).

###### Less arrests after COVID-19 in all five boroughs
When we look at the distribution of arrests across the five boroughs of New York City, we notice that the pattern is similar to the one observed for complaints. Manhattan stands out with the highest number of arrests per 100,000 residents, followed by the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, while Staten Island has the lowest number of arrests.

*Figure 3: Arrests per 100,000 residents across boroughs*
<iframe src="https://raw.githack.com/Sdataanalyse/Sdataanalyse.github.io/main/Pictures/Arrest_map_per_100.html" width="130%" height="650px"></iframe>
However, there is an interesting twist in the data for the year 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. While all districts experienced a decrease in arrests, Manhattan saw a larger drop compared to the Bronx, with arrests per 100,000 residents declining from 1856 to 1152, while the Bronx decreased from 1785 to 1196. Surprisingly, this resulted in the Bronx having the highest arrest rate per capita that year, despite Manhattan consistently holding that position in other years. This raises the question: what factors contributed to the Bronx surpassing Manhattan in arrests per 100,000 residents in 2020?"

There can be many underlying factors, but it is interesting to note that deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 were nearly twice as high in the Bronx as in Manhattan (Kisser et al., 2020). This may have been influenced by people's ability to work from home and the opportunities to leave the city, which were primarily available to those in the wealthiest neighborhoods. As a result, residents in the Bronx were more exposed to the risks of COVID-19 and faced a greater risk of violence compared to residents in Manhattan. These factors may help explain the higher number of complaints per resident in the Bronx in 2020 when COVID-19 was at its peak (Wollf et al., 2022).

#### Less crime in NYC during COVID-19, but prostitution, murder and burglary kept increasing 
During COVID-19 there was less crime in NYC compared to before the pandemic. However, looking at the ten most affected crimes in NYC separately, this is not the full story. Crime categories as prostitution, murder and burglary all saw big increases in 2020, compared to 2019.
<iframe src="https://raw.githack.com/Sdataanalyse/Sdataanalyse.github.io/main/Pictures/Complaint_arrest_focus_share.html" width="130%" height="650px"></iframe>
##### Record high number of prostitution complaints in NYC under COVID-19, but the number of arrests keeps falling
In 2020 more people submitted complaints regarding prostitution, meanwhile fewer people got arrested for prostitution. Compared to 2019, the number of prostitution complaints goes up with 273.7 % (57 from 213), while prostitution arrests go down with 52.2% (1104 vs. 472). 

*Figure 4: Yearly change in % for selected focus crimes, 2019-2022*
<iframe src="https://raw.githack.com/Sdataanalyse/Sdataanalyse.github.io/main/Pictures/Complaint_arrest_focus1.html" width="130%" height="650px"></iframe>
However the number of prostitution arrests still exceeds the number of complaints. A reason for this can be that individuals involved in the sex industry are less likely to report such activities. Stigma, fear of legal repercussions, and the discrete nature of the crime contribute to underreporting. 

One of the main reasons why there year by year have been fewer people getting arrested for prostitution in NYC, compared to before COVID-19, is due to the fact, that there have been a more focus on the area, since it was found that police officers falsely arresting people for prostitution, which may explain the falling number of arrests (Trujillo 2021).
Evenmore the focus has shifted from penalizing sex workers to instead targeting those who exploit or traffick individuals involved in the sex trade (Bromwich 2021).

###### Prostitution spike in the Bronx in 2020 as other boroughs witness downturn
Delving deeper into the complaints data, a striking pattern emerges, while other boroughs experienced a decline in prostitution cases, the Bronx witnessed a significant increase. In figure 5 if we look at “prostitution and related offenses” we can see that from 21 complaints in 2019, the numbers skyrocketed to 204 in 2020, only to decline to 15 in 2021 and 11 in 2022. This observation potentially sheds light on the rise in prostitution complaints in 2020. 

*Figure 5: Yearly number of complaints across boroughs, 2019-2022*
<iframe src="https://raw.githack.com/Sdataanalyse/Sdataanalyse.github.io/main/Pictures/Complaint_Borough.html" width="110%" height="650px"></iframe>
In addition to an increase in complaints, the Bronx has also witnessed a surge in prostitution-related arrests. The number of arrests rose from 170 in 2019 to 248 in 2020, contrasting with the downward trend observed in the other boroughs.

*Figure 6: Yearly number of arrests across boroughs, 2019-2022*
<iframe src="https://raw.githack.com/Sdataanalyse/Sdataanalyse.github.io/main/Pictures/Arrest_borough.html" width="110%" height="650px"></iframe>
However, the intriguing question remains: what factors are specifically driving this increase in the Bronx? During our research, it appears that this particular subject has not received significant attention previously, suggesting that it remains an area worthy of further investigation.

##### Murders/homicides in NYC has become more common under COVID-19
Homicides/murders in NYC became more common during the pandemic, jolting the perception of a city once called “the safest big city in America.” Marcius & Shanahan 2023). Compared with the “before-COVID-level” NYC saw a steadily increasing number of murders/homicides in the whole period from 2019-2022. In that periode the number of complaints increased by 83.4% (from 301 to 552) and arrests by 64.8% (from 1013 to 1669). 

*Figure 7: Yearly change for complaints/arrests in numbers, 2019-2022*
<iframe src="https://raw.githack.com/Sdataanalyse/Sdataanalyse.github.io/main/Pictures/Complaint_arrest_focus_total.html" width="130%" height="650px"></iframe>
###### New Yorkers fells more insecure, than before the pandemic
It should be kept in mind that just before COVID, the murder rate was the lowest NYC has seen in decades and that the murder level during the pandemic, was not near the level we say in 1980s and early 1990s, where there in average was six killings each day, compared to around five killings each day in 2022 (Akinnibi & Wahid, 2022).
However, today the New Yorkers feel more insecure than they did before the pandemic. In the Quinnipiac University poll, 3 out of 4 New Yorkers said that the crime level was a “very serious” problem, which is the highest number since the question was first asked in 1999. (Quinnipiac University Poll. 2022) 
It’s specially the shooting incidents, which have left NYC on edge. in the first six months of 2022, there was 639 shooting indicidents in NYC, nearly double up compared to the same period in 2019 (Akinnibi & Wahid, 2022).

###### Bronx leads in murder arrests
*First it is crucial to highlight that the data on murder complaints for the boroughs is not accurate because 1209 out of 1778 complaints are not registered in a borough. From 2019 to 2021 there are almost zore murder complaints that are regitret in a boroug, whereas all the murder complaints in 2022 are reigstreret in a borough. Therefore, it does not provide an accurate representation of murder complaints in the five boroughs. However, this is not the case for arrests.*

In New York, nearly a quarter of all homicides and shooting incidents are concentrated in five of the city’s 77 police precincts, located in mostly low-income neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx. In 2021 there were 5.7 homicides per 100,000 people in New York City (Akinnibi & Wahid, 2022).

Upon looking at the crimetype “murder & non-negl. manslaughter” in figure 6, it becomes apparent that the Bronx also consistently exhibits the highest number of murder arrests throughout the five-year period. Following the Bronx, Brooklyn closely trails behind, with Manhattan also showing a notable presence. Conversely, Staten Island consistently records the lowest number of murder arrests, peaking at 54 in 2020.

It is worth noting that all boroughs experienced an increase in murder arrests in 2020, coinciding with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, both the Bronx and Brooklyn witnessed a continuous rise in their arrest figures, lending support to the notion that New Yorkers have perceived a heightened sense of insecurity following the onset of the pandemic, despite reductions in various other crime types.

Criminologists attribute the rise in murder rates to various pandemic-related factors such as mental health impacts, challenges faced by law enforcement, reduced community outreach, increased gang violence, and a surge in gun ownership among first-time buyers (Arango & Fuller, 2020). 
A study from the University of California, Davis, revealed that around 110,000 Californians purchased firearms in response to pandemic concerns, supported by a significant increase in background checks. Additionally, Los Angeles has seen a 45% increase in car-related gun thefts, some of which have been linked to shootings. The combination of these factors, along with the hardships and despair experienced during the pandemic, may have contributed to the rise in murder cases (Arango & Fuller, 2020).

##### Burglary increases with over 40% doing COVID-19 
Under the COVID-19 burglary complaints saw a increase at over 40% - 4796 more burglary complaints than in 2019. 
During the reopenings in 2021 the burglary tends to decrease, for hereafter reaching the same crime level in 2022 as was seen in 2020.

##### Manhattan tops the charts in burglary rise
In 2020, burglary rates witnessed an increase across all boroughs of NYC in both complaints and arrests (see burglary in figure 5 and 6). However, Manhattan experienced the most substantial surge, with arrests jumping from 1,394 in 2019 to 2,618 in 2020. Interestingly, there was a subsequent decline in burglary incidents citywide in 2021, followed by a resurgence in 2022.

The surge in Manhattan can be attributed to the unique circumstances during the initial COVID-19 lockdown. As businesses and offices closed, many people began working from home, leaving commercial establishments unattended. This created an opportune environment for burglaries, which may have resulted in the observed increase in burglaries across all boroughs (Champman & Morris 2020). 

Compared to the other boroughs, Manhattan has a clear advantage when it comes to business concentration. It is renowned for its vibrant financial district, home to influential institutions such as major banks, investment firms, and the New York Stock Exchange. This concentration of economic activity in Manhattan could provide insight into why the borough experienced a notable increase in burglary in 2020. With many people being sent home from work due to lockdown measures, businesses and offices were left unoccupied, potentially making them more vulnerable to burglary incidents.

The decline in the number of burglaries for both complaints and arrests in 2021 can be attributed to the return of more people to work after covid-19. However, there was a subsequent increase in burglary cases in 2022, coinciding with the impact of inflation. Criminologists have suggested that rising prices can contribute to an increase in burglaries (Hogg, 2022).

#### 2023 - what then?
While we have examined the crime rates from the past year, it remains uncertain how they will evolve in the future. Predicting future crime rates is a complex task that depends on various factors, including social, economic, and policy changes. It is essential to continue monitoring and analyzing crime data over time to gain insights into potential trends and patterns that may influence future crime rates. 

Already in March 2023, the crime rates for murder and burglary for example showed positive trends. Homicides decreased by 11.4% compared to the same period in the previous year, continuing the downward trend in homicides over the first three months of 2023, which saw a 12.7% decrease.
Similarly, burglary rates demonstrated a significant reduction, with a decrease of 12.5% in March 2023 compared to the previous year. This decline in burglaries aligns with the ongoing progress seen in the first quarter of 2023, where burglary rates dropped by 6.1% (New York City Police Department 2023)

According to the NYPD the earlier high numbers of major crime arrests, including murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and grand larceny of a motor vehicle can be explained by The NYPD prioritizing apprehending individuals involved in serious offenses such as these crimetypes. The emphasis has been on proactive law enforcement and targeting repeat offenders (Coltin, J.2023)

With the reduction in both murder and burglary rates this may have worked. However it is important to continue addressing persistent issues and maintaining the momentum in crime prevention. Here data analysis and visualization as we have done above plays a crucial role in identifying target crimes and high-risk areas for law enforcement. By analyzing relevant data, police can determine which types of crimes to focus on and allocate their resources accordingly. Additionally, data analysis helps in identifying specific geographical areas where criminal activities are more prevalent, enabling law enforcement to concentrate their efforts in those locations for proactive crime prevention.
