## Background/introduction 


### More complaints after COVID-19 in all five boroughs 
As previously noted, the number of complaints in 2022 exceeded that of 2019, despite a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to delve deeper into this phenomenon, we will examine the five boroughs of New York City to determine if this trend is uniform across the board. 
The accompanying map illustrates the frequency of complaints per 100,000 residents in each borough.

The maps show that all five districts share a common pattern: complaints dropped in 2020 and then began to rise again in 2021, ultimately resulting in the highest number of complaints in 2022 as compared to the previous three years. However, only Queens had already exceeded the number of complaints per 100,000 residents in 2021 compared to 2019.
Likewise, the distribution of complaints across the five boroughs shows a consistent trend, with Manhattan having the highest number of complaints per 100,000 residents, followed by the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, with Staten Island at the bottom.
Manhattan, as the borough with the highest population density, represents a vibrant tapestry of residents hailing from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses. This unique amalgamation of people can give rise to a greater likelihood of potential conflicts, which subsequently contributes to a higher volume of reported complaints.
Conversely, The Bronx, while not as ethnically diverse as Manhattan, faces its own distinct set of challenges. The borough is characterized by a comparatively higher poverty rate, with median incomes roughly half of what is seen in areas such as Staten Island or Queens. This economic disparity can be correlated with higher crime rates and, consequently, a greater number of reported complaints (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235222000496)

# Less arrests after COVID-19 in all five boroughs 
As previously mentioned, there was a decline in arrests following the COVID-19 outbreak when compared to 2019. To gain more insight into this trend, we will take a closer look at the boroughs and determine whether the decrease in arrests is consistent across all of them as we saw for complaints. The map illustrates the number of arrests per 100,000 residents.

When we look at the distribution of arrests across the five boroughs of New York City, we notice that the pattern is similar to the one observed for complaints. Manhattan stands out with the highest number of arrests per 100,000 residents, followed by the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, while Staten Island has the lowest number of arrests.
However, there is an interesting twist in the data for the year 2020. While all districts experienced a decrease in arrests, Manhattan had a larger drop than Bronx, going from 1856 to 1152 arrests per 100,000 residents, while Bronx decreased from 1785 to 1196 arrests per 100,000 residents. As a result, the Bronx had the most arrests per capita that year, even though Manhattan had the most complaints. There can be many factors related to this. However, it may be explained by the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. According to a study (reference) examining violence in New York City throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in assault incidents during the social unrest following the killing of George Floyd. Interestingly, this increase was particularly driving by the Bronx, offering a potential explanation for the borough having the highest number of arrests per 100,000 residents in 2020
It's worth noting that despite the increase in arrests in 2021 and 2022, none of the boroughs have yet reached the same level of arrests as before the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend is consistent across all five boroughs, and it begs the question of what factors may be contributing to this overall decrease in arrests when comparing 2022 to 2019, even as complaints continue to rise.

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
