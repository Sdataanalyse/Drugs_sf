In the start of 2020 the whole world got impacted by the Corona pandemic, which lead to a dramatic change in everyday life for people all of the world (Wollf et al., 2022). 
Because the scaling number of positive COVID-19’s cases, there were quickly implemented strict lockdown in numerous cities around the world. In NYC, state of emergency was declared on March 12 , 2020, which meant that the New Yorkers should stay at home, observe social distancing, closing non-essential businesses, schools, restaurants, gyms, and playgrounds. 
The first lockdown period in NYC lasted from March 12 to June 7, 2020, whose purpose was to flatten out the curve of COVID-19 infections. After the first lockdown period, a series of structured reopenings phases was initiated, which lasted to the end of July 2021. The reopenings was followed by second and third “waves” of higher infections (Wollf et al., 2022).
It quickly became the “new normal”, not only in NYC but all of the world, which led to big social changes such as a change in criminal behavior (Wollf et al., 2022) (City of New York Criminal Justice Agency, 2020.)

#### Changing criminal behavior in NYC due to COVID-19
Upon a quick glance at the data, it is evident that New York City (NYC) experienced a significant overall decrease in the number of crime complaints and arrests for the ten most affected crime categories (Sex crimes, Drugs, Burglary, Larceny, Assault, Murder, Rape, Robbery, Prostitution, and Disorderly Conduct) during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

This trend aligns with the general pattern observed in cities worldwide, where crime initially dropped in the early weeks of the COVID-19 shutdown but began to rise afterward as residents grappled with the economic and health consequences of the pandemic (Bloomberg, 2022).

In NYC, the number of crime complaints decreased by 11.3% (from 230,982 to 204,797), and arrests experienced an even more substantial decline of 32.2% (from 106,190 to 71,972) in 2020 compared to 2019 (see figure 1). Although the number of crime complaints started to increase in towards 2021, it remained below the pre-pandemic level.

##### Higher level of crime in NYC after COVID-19
Christopher Herrmann, assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, states that the overall picture for 2022 statistics in New York City is alarming, with a significant increase in crime. According to Herrmann, "crime is up in New York City, and it's up quite a bit" (New York Times, 2023). This increase is reflected in the number of crime complaints, which rose by 15.6% (from 230,982 to 267,012) compared to pre-COVID levels in 2019, reaching the highest level within the period.

In contrast, arrests experienced a decline in 2022, with a decrease of 11.4%. This decline was mainly driven by significant drops in cases related to disorderly conduct, drugs, and prostitution.
###### More complaints after COVID-19 in all five districts 
Looking at the distribution of complaints across the five boroughs in New York City, it is clear that all of boroughs follow a similar pattern: complaints dropped in 2020 and then began to rise again in 2021, ultimately resulting in the highest number of complaints in 2022 as compared to the previous three years. 
*Figure 2: Complaints per 100,000 residents across boroughs*

Furthermore, the distribution of complaints across the five boroughs shows a consistent trend, with Manhattan having the highest number of complaints per 100,000 residents, followed by the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, with Staten Island at the bottom.
Manhattan, as the borough with the highest population density, represents a vibrant tapestry of residents hailing from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses. This unique amalgamation of people can give rise to a greater likelihood of potential conflicts, which subsequently contributes to a higher volume of reported complaints.
Conversely, The Bronx, while not as ethnically diverse as Manhattan, faces its own distinct set of challenges. The borough is characterized by a comparatively higher poverty rate, with median incomes roughly half of what is seen in areas such as Staten Island or Queens. This economic disparity can be correlated with higher crime rates and, consequently, a greater number of reported complaints (Wollf et al., 2022).

###### Less arrests after COVID-19 in all five boroughs
When we look at the distribution of arrests across the five boroughs of New York City, we notice that the pattern is similar to the one observed for complaints. Manhattan stands out with the highest number of arrests per 100,000 residents, followed by the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, while Staten Island has the lowest number of arrests.

However, there is an interesting twist in the data for the year 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. While all districts experienced a decrease in arrests, Manhattan saw a larger drop compared to the Bronx, with arrests per 100,000 residents declining from 1856 to 1152, while the Bronx decreased from 1785 to 1196. Surprisingly, this resulted in the Bronx having the highest arrest rate per capita that year, despite Manhattan consistently holding that position in other years. This raises the question: what factors contributed to the Bronx surpassing Manhattan in arrests per 100,000 residents in 2020?"

There can be many underlying factors, but it is interesting to note that deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 were nearly twice as high in the Bronx as in Manhattan (Kisser et al., 2020). This may have been influenced by people's ability to work from home and the opportunities to leave the city, which were primarily available to those in the wealthiest neighborhoods. As a result, residents in the Bronx were more exposed to the risks of COVID-19 and faced a greater risk of violence compared to residents in Manhattan. These factors may help explain the higher number of complaints per resident in the Bronx in 2020 when COVID-19 was at its peak (Wollf et al., 2022).

##### Less crime in NYC during COVID-19, but prostitution, murder and burglary kept increasing

###### Record high number of prostitution complaints in NYC under COVID-19, but the number of arrests keeps falling

###### Prostitution spike in the Bronx in 2020 as other boroughs witness downturn
Delving deeper into the complaints data, a striking pattern emerges, while other boroughs experienced a decline in prostitution cases, the Bronx witnessed a significant increase. In figure ?? we can see that from 21 complaints in 2019, the numbers skyrocketed to 204 in 2020, only to decline to 15 in 2021 and 11 in 2022. This observation potentially sheds light on the rise in prostitution complaints in 2020. 
<iframe src="https://raw.githack.com/Sdataanalyse/Sdataanalyse.github.io/main/Pictures/Complaint_Borough.html" width="110%" height="650px"></iframe>
It is crucial to highlight that the data on murder complaints for the boroughs is not accurate because 1209 out of 1778 complaints are not registered in a borough. Therefore, it does not provide an accurate representation of murder complaints in the five boroughs. However, this is not the case for arrests.

In addition to an increase in complaints, the Bronx has also witnessed a surge in prostitution-related arrests. The number of arrests rose from 170 in 2019 to 248 in 2020, contrasting with the downward trend observed in the other boroughs.

However, the intriguing question remains: what factors are specifically driving this increase in the Bronx? During our research, it appears that this particular subject has not received significant attention previously, suggesting that it remains an area worthy of further investigation.

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
