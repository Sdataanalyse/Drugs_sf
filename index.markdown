# Introduction to the dataset 
The data comes from DataSF which is a an official open data portal of the City and County of San Francisco. The DataSF portal provides access to a wide range of data sets, including crime incidents. The data sets are produced by various departments and agencies of the city government. (DataSF. (n.d.). Home page. Retrieved March 25, 2023, from https://datasf.org/)

In this project we use the dataset "Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018". The dataset has 14 columns and 2.13M rows, where each row is an incident report. The dataset includes information about the date and time of the incident, the location, the type of crime, and other details related to the incident. It's important to note that this data only reflects reported incidents to the San Francisco Police Department, and may not capture all crimes that occur in the city.

In this project we look at the crime category DRUGS/NARCOTICS. This crime category provides informations about drug-related crimes reported to the San Francisco Police Department

The map illustrates that Tenderloin is the district with the highest number of reported incidents of drug/narcotic from 2003 to 2018. There has been reported 37.365 incidents in this district.

There can be several reasons behind Tenderloin's high incidence of drug-related issues. Although it covers a relatively small area of San Francisco, the district is densely populated and the area have a long history of poverty, homelessness, and drug abuse.

Many of the people living in Tenderloin are living in poverty and have limited opportunities for employment and education. This can lead to an increased risk of drug abuse and related problems. The district has a long-standing history of being a refuge for people suffering from addiction and in dire need, which has perpetuated the drug problem.
